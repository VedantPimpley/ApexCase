# ApexCase - Text Capitalizer Extension

ApexCase is a browser extension which lets you easily change the capitalization of the text that's being edited. The simple UI lets the user quickly change the capitalization to match the intended tone and utility of the text.

## Usage

On a webpage, go to an input element. Select the text you wish to modify. Right click on it, and hover over the 'ApexCase Capitalizer' option. 
This will reveal a submenu with four options.

1. **Undo last action**: Reverts the last capitalization action performed, along with any changes made to the text following that action. Do note that undo can only revert the last action, and this cannot be chained to do multiple undos.

2. **Capitalize entire selection**: All alphabets [a-z] will be replaced by their respective upper case alphabets.

3. **Capitalize first letter of each word**: Only the first letter of each word will be capitalized, leaving all the other characters as they are.

4. **Capitalize first letter of first word in each sentence**: Only the first letter of the first word of each sentence will be capitalized, leaving all the other characters as they are. This is the generally the norm in English.
